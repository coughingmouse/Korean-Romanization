## Introduction
It [seems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Korean?wprov=sfti1
) romanization of Korean is in general not in a great condition. So I decided I'd make a [better one that may come in handy](https://xkcd.com/927/).

## Korean Specific Additions

Spacing, hyphenation, etc. follow [한글맞춤법](https://kornorms.korean.go.kr/m/m_regltn.do#a).

Punctuation marks follow [한글맞춤법](https://kornorms.korean.go.kr/m/m_regltn.do#a) 부록. But additionally, 
1. Quotation marks are preferred over other types of punctuations.
1. For 숨김표, 동그라미표 ⟨○⟩ is preferred over 가새표 ⟨×⟩, to avoid confusion with ⟨x⟩
1. American conventions regarding typographic forms are recommended.
1. Use ⟨.⟩ to separate by syllables.
1. For academic usage for what is not specified here, various practices using Yale Romanization are accepted.

These are the better ways to write in latin letters, but they are not transliterally compatible with older systems. Here are some suggestions.

1. Write 사이히읗 as ⟨h⟩

| 가당치도 | qadagchido |
| 가당ㅎ지도 | qadaghcido |

2. Write ⟨d⟩ whenever archaic word s exists and is not pronounced as a liquid, and ⟨n⟩ when pronounced as a liquid (in front of ⟨i⟩/⟨y⟩)

* Respect the historic usage of Latin Letters
* Be Korean while designing
* Be intuitive for Koreans
* Be intuitive for English users
* Be intuitive for Chinese

## Why...?

There are some transcription systems in use, the most common being Revised Romanization of Korean, but they just don't work. As for the RRK, the transcription system relies on the pronunciation, but also because there's not enough correlation between the romanized forms and the form written in Korea-originated scripts. Korean is a language with numerous liasons and sandhis. Phonetic transcription makes it impossible to comprehend what the words are. They tried to mitigate that by making a complex hyphenation system that is only used for the romanization, and is not very well kept anyway. All in all, it kinda works when you're trying to make someone pronounce a meaningless phrase without knowing what it means. The romanization is too complicated for uses other than just that.

Yale Romanization of Korean is used often and it's a pretty sound system overall, but there are slight problems regarding intuitivity, casual readability, and effeciency. It also doesn't get much support from Korea just because it wasn't made in or by a Korean, which is quite significant to the point that RRK is being more often used instead where it should not be.

The differences from the Yale Romanization are as follows.
