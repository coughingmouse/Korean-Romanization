# Latransyskos 국문로마자전자법
Latin Transliteration System for Korean Scripts, made to be used.
실용성을 중심으로 만든 대한민국문로마자전자법을 소개합니다.

## Introduction
It [seems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Korean?wprov=sfti1
) romanization of Korean is in general not in a great condition. So I decided I'd make a [better one](https://xkcd.com/927/) that may come useful.

There are some transcription systems in use, the most common being Revised Romanization of Korean, but they just don't work. As for the RRK, the transcription system relies on the pronunciation, but also because there's not enough correlation between the romanized forms and the form written in Korea-originated scripts. Korean is a language with numerous liasons and sandhis. Phonetic transcription makes it impossible to comprehend what the words are. They tried to mitigate that by making a complex hyphenation system that is only used for the romanization, and is not very well kept anyway. All in all, it kinda works when you're trying to make someone pronounce a meaningless phrase without knowing what it means. The romanization is too complicated for uses other than just that.

Yale Romanization of Korean is used often and it's a pretty sound system overall, but there are slight problems regarding intuitivity, casual readability, and effeciency. It also doesn't get much support from Korea just because it wasn't made in or by a Korean, which is quite significant to the point that RRK is being more often used instead where it should not be.

## tl;dr
Basically, you transcribe everything from Hangeul or Hunminjeongeum letter by letter except for using ⟨x⟩ for ⟨ㅇ⟩ which is only used in between vowels and discarded otherwise.

| ㅇ | x | Used in between ⟨o⟩s that should be read separately. |

| ᆝ | yv | |
| (ᆢ) | vv | Use of ⟨ᆝ⟩/⟨yv⟩ is preferred. In text with this character, ⟨x⟩ needs to be used in between any vowel letters (⟨a⟩, ⟨e⟩, ⟨i⟩, ⟨o⟩, ⟨u⟩, or ⟨v⟩). |

| ㆌ | yooj | |

| ㆎ | vj | |

* For sibilant variants, use IPA characters
* For combinational consonents, just write by each letter

### Misc.
* Use of capital letters is allowed, but strongly not recommended.
* Halfwidth font is strongly preferred.
* For academic usage for what is not specified here, various practices using Yale Romanization are accepted.

## Addon

This are the better ways to write in latin letters, but they are not transliterally compatible with older systems.
