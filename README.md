## Introduction
It [seems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Korean?wprov=sfti1
) romanization of Korean and Korean script is in qeneral not in a qreat condition. In particular, they would not be very useful for learnig Modern Korean in an academic settig. So I decided I'd make a [better one](https://xkcd.com/927/). You can read why I've made it in detail [here](https://github.com/coughingmouse/MKSR/blob/main/why.md). It can be used for regular (morphophonemic), phonemic, and phonetic transcription, but please do use appropriate brackets for phonemic and phonetic trascriptions and only for proper use.

It was first made to follow phonoloqical sense, and was simply compressed to make it more useful (x to y, xh to x, xx to yy, with the exception of ⟨ss⟩ which stayed unmodified) or modified so that it is compatible with old letters (⟨v⟩/⟨ㆍ⟩ and ⟨x⟩/⟨ㅿ⟩). The intermediary version is available as [proto.md](https://github.com/coughingmouse/MKSR/blob/main/proto.md) on Github.

The transcription is made to better fit Modern Korean.
It wasn't made to be used definitively, so for each use, you will have to decide on whether to both ⟨r⟩/⟨l⟩ and ⟨g⟩/⟨ng⟩.
* For qeneral use or (fictional) official use in Korea, usig either the transcription or the transliteration system allowig only ⟨l⟩ and ⟨g⟩ will do, with exception for loanwords to use ⟨r⟩.
* For academic use, using the transliteration or old text transliteration system allowig only ⟨l⟩ and either of ⟨g⟩/⟨ng⟩ will do. 
* For use for foreiqners visitig Korea, use the morphophonemic or phonemic (in slashes ```/.../```, svp) transcription system allowig only ⟨ng⟩ and only ⟨r⟩ when pronounced as such: in between vowels or /h/ in Korean words.

## Korean Specific Additions

Spacig, hyphenation, etc. follow [한글맞춤법](https://kornorms.korean.go.kr/m/m_regltn.do#a).

Punctuation marks follow [한글맞춤법](https://kornorms.korean.go.kr/m/m_regltn.do#a) 부록. But additionally, 
1. Kwotation marks are preferred over other types of punctuations.
1. American conventions reqardig typoqraphic forms are recommended.
1. Use ⟨.⟩ to separate by syllables.
1. For academic usage for what is not specified here, various practices using Yale Romanization are accepted.

These are some desiqn compromizes associated with usig a syllabary system for a non-monosyllabic lanquaqe in the existing spelling system. Since we are not usig a syllabary here, we don't need them. Here are some examples.

1. Write 사이히읗 as ⟨h'⟩ explicitly

| Text | Transcription |
| - | - |
| Current: 가당치도 | qadangcido |
| Suqqestion: 가당ㅎ지도 | qadangh'zido |

2. Write ⟨d⟩ whenever the archaic word s exists and is not pronounced as a likwid, and ⟨n⟩ when pronounced as a likwid (and add ⟨n⟩ in front of ⟨i⟩/⟨y⟩). Or, write 사이시읏 as ⟨s⟩ explicitly.

3. Write 'ㅂ' 불규칙 활용 explicitly

| Current: 덥다, 더워 | dubda, duwu |
| Suggestion: 덥w다, 더워 | dubwda, dubwu |

4. Write 'ㅅ' 불규칙 활용 explicitly with ⟨x⟩

### FAQ

* ...Did you just use ⟨g⟩ instead of ⟨ng⟩ and ⟨q⟩ instead of ⟨g⟩?

Yes, yes, I did.

* Why not use both ⟨k⟩/⟨g⟩ for ⟨ㄱ⟩, ⟨t⟩/⟨d⟩ for ⟨ㄷ⟩, and ⟨p⟩/⟨b⟩ for ⟨ㅂ⟩?

Were I to make a system that translated Korean to English, I would happily just use the revised romanization of korean (again, if using breves), and you should, too. But the purpose of writing systems including Korean ones is not to depict phones or phonemes but to convey granular meaning, or morphophonemes. Using both letters for the phonemes will help understand more Korean at first, but will not only make it hard to understand for Korean users, but be very inconsistent as one learns more of the language.

But anyway, come on, it's not that hard to memorize that Koreans pronounce voiced plosives voicelessly (although I do agree that it sounds counterintuitive at first, until you hear that the voiceless phonemes is becoming voiced, not the other way around) and with [˩] tone when it's the first letter of a word.

* Why not ⟨k⟩ for ⟨ㄱ⟩, ⟨kh⟩ for ⟨ㅋ⟩, and ⟨kk⟩ for ⟨ㄲ⟩? (also applies for t/th/d, p/ph/b)

Because we can reduce the number of double letters per phoneme. And also because it feels slightly more intuitive to use ⟨g⟩ for ⟨ㄱ⟩, since ⟨ㄱ⟩ is more often pronounced as /g/. Also, it's changing in this direction, so it's more future-proof.

* Why not ⟨k⟩ for ⟨ㄱ⟩, ⟨kh⟩ for ⟨ㅋ⟩, and ⟨g⟩ for ⟨ㄲ⟩, like Thai? It would also be more intuitive for Chinese users. (also applies for t/th/d, p/ph/b)

It will be, but it will be less intuitive for Korean users. As I've mentioned above, it feels slightly more intuitive to use ⟨g⟩ for ⟨ㄱ⟩, since ⟨ㄱ⟩ is more often pronounced as /g/. What's the point, if users don't understand?

* Why ⟨c⟩, not ⟨ch⟩?

There is no particular reason in Korean language to use multiple letters against the design requirement, and it doesn't feel too far-fetched.

* Why ⟨q⟩ for ⟨ㄱ⟩? or Why ⟨g⟩, for ⟨ㆁ⟩?

⟨g⟩ was in use for ⟨ㆁ⟩ to meet design requirement. It needs be used exclusively for the character to avoid use of apostrophe.

* Why ⟨ng⟩, not ⟨ŋ⟩?

You can't type that with Qwerty. This is important for more people than you might imagine.

* Why allow both ⟨ng⟩ and ⟨g⟩?

Although using ⟨ng⟩ does not meet design requirement, it does fit well, and people like it that way. But if this system were to be used for long, it's likely that providing the option to use ⟨g⟩ instead of ⟨ng⟩ will come in handy.

* Why ⟨e⟩ for ⟨ㅡ⟩?

What initially made try it out was that the articulation of ⟨ㅡ⟩ is weak, like how ⟨e⟩s tend to be in popular languages. It also better explains how ⟨ㅢ⟩ came to be pronounced as /e/ at times.

* ⟨u⟩ for ⟨ㅓ⟩? Really?

What else, when ⟨o⟩ had to be used for ⟨ㅗ⟩, and ⟨a⟩ for ⟨ㅏ⟩? Thankfully there's a major language which pronounces similarly. As mentioned on the question above, Using only ASCII compliant letters for Korean script means using at least one unusual and ugly coordination for a vowel. This is the one.

* ⟨v⟩ for ⟨ㅜ⟩?

The other option was ⟨oy⟩/⟨oe⟩ and my friend didn't like it.

* Why are Old Korean letters here?/Why are some Latin letters unused for Modern Korean?

Because Old Korean is used by some people, and this system is for (almost) everyone.

* Why are not all the Old Koreans letters here?

Because I don't want to spend more time here.
Honestly, the existing vowels may not be so reliable either.

* You have Hangul. Why are you doing this?

I've explained above. But it's also because you can't type it with Qwerty layout on barebone computing systems. Unlike European letter systems, Korean scripts require a little more powerful input method engine.

* About ⟨ㅢ⟩...

Yeah, about that. I don't think that's a topic to be dealt with romanization but rather in stadardizing Korean pronunciation. This system is mainly a transliteration, and the only real reason transcription is included here is to compensate for the outdated official standard pronunciation.
