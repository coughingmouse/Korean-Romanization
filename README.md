## Introduction
It [seems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Korean?wprov=sfti1
) romanization of Korean is in general not in a great condition. In particular, they would not be very useful for learning Modern Korean in an academic setting. So I decided I'd make a [better one that may come in handy](https://xkcd.com/927/). It can be used for mapping regular, phonemic, and phonetic transcription, but please do use appropriate brackets for phonemic and phonetic trascriptions and only for proper use.

It was first made to follow phonological sense, and was simply compressed to make it more useful (x to y, xh to x, xx to yy, with the exception of ⟨ss⟩ which stayed unmodified) or modified so that it could be more intuitive (⟨v⟩ to ⟨oo⟩) and be compatible with old letters (⟨v⟩/⟨ㆍ⟩ and ⟨x⟩/⟨ㅿ⟩). The intermediary version is available as [proto.md](https://github.com/coughingmouse/MKSR/blob/main/proto.md) on Github.

* For sibilant variants, use IPA equivalent and use of X-SAMPA is allowed
* For combinational letters, just write them out by each compositing letter
* Capital Latin letters are not used by default, but ⟨Q⟩, ⟨D⟩, ⟨B⟩, ⟨Z⟩ may be used to abbreviate ⟨qq⟩, ⟨dd⟩, ⟨bb⟩, and ⟨zz⟩. But it's strongly not recommended, as this practice does not play well with the conventions regarding letter cases.

### Misc.
* Halfwidth font is strongly preferred.

## Korean Specific Additions

Spacing, hyphenation, etc. follow [한글맞춤법](https://kornorms.korean.go.kr/m/m_regltn.do#a).

Punctuation marks follow [한글맞춤법](https://kornorms.korean.go.kr/m/m_regltn.do#a) 부록. But additionally, 
1. Quotation marks are preferred over other types of punctuations.
1. American conventions regarding typographic forms are recommended.
1. Use ⟨.⟩ to separate by syllables.
1. For academic usage for what is not specified here, various practices using Yale Romanization are accepted.

These are the better ways to write in latin letters, but they are not transliterally compatible with older systems. Here are some suggestions.

1. Write 사이히읗 as ⟨h'⟩ explicitly

| Text | Transcription Suggestion | Phonemic Transcription Suggestion | Phonetic Transcription Suggestion |
| - | - | - | - |
| 가당치도 | qadagcido | qadaghzido | qadagcido
| 가당ㅎ지도 | qadagh'zido | qadaghzido | qadagcido

2. Write ⟨d⟩ whenever archaic word s exists and is not pronounced as a liquid, and ⟨n⟩ when pronounced as a liquid (in front of ⟨i⟩/⟨y⟩)

| Text | Suggestion | Alternative | Current |

| 숫자 | soodza | | soosza |
| 멸족 | myuldzog | myuldzoŋ | myulszog |
| 냇가 | nejdga | najdga | nejsga |
| 콧등 | koddeng | | kosdeng |
| 나뭇잎 | namoonip | | namoosip |
| 한 일 | hann il | | han il |
| 할 일 | haln il | | hal il |

## Design Goals

* Don't be a D.
* Make an alphabetic transliteration system, not a spelling reform
* Use Latin letters
* Use only the standard Latin Letters for the transliteration of modern Korean
* Avoid using two or more letters for a single phoneme
* Make it computer friendly
* Respect coalescence and the historic usage of Hangeul and Hunminjeongeum
* Respect the historic usage of Latin Letters
* Be Korean while designing
* Be intuitive for Koreans
* Be intuitive for English users
* Be intuitive for Chinese

## Why...?

There are some transcription systems in use, the most common being Revised Romanization of Korean, but they just don't work. As for the RRK, the transcription system relies on the pronunciation, but also because there's not enough correlation between the romanized forms and the form written in Korea-originated scripts. Korean is a language with numerous liasons and sandhis. Phonetic transcription makes it impossible to comprehend what the words are. They tried to mitigate that by making a complex hyphenation system that is only used for the romanization, and is not very well kept anyway. All in all, it kinda works when you're trying to make someone pronounce a meaningless phrase without knowing what it means. The romanization is too complicated for uses other than just that.

Yale Romanization of Korean is used often and it's a pretty sound system overall, but there are slight problems regarding intuitivity, casual readability, and effeciency, all of which are not critical in academic use case but more necessary in everyday use. It also doesn't get much support from Korea just because it wasn't made in or by a Korean, which is quite significant to the point that RRK is being more often used where it should not be.

The main differences from the Yale Romanization are as follows.

| ㅇ | ' | G | Difference in usage |
| ㆍ | v | o |
| ㅓ | u | e |
| ㅡ | e | u |
| ㅜ | oo | wu |
| ㅐ | ej | aj | ⟨aj⟩ in old text and transliteration. |
| ㅔ | ej | uj | ⟨uj⟩ in old text and transliteration. |
| ㄱ | q | k |
| ㄷ | d | t |
| ㅂ | b | p |
| ㅋ | k | kh |
| ㅌ | t | th |
| ㅍ | p | ph |
| ㄲ | qq | kk | ⟨Q⟩ is allowed but strongly not recommended. |
| ㄸ | dd | tt | ⟨D⟩ is allowed but strongly not recommended. |
| ㅃ | bb | pp | ⟨B⟩ is allowed but strongly not recommended. |
| ㆁ | g | ng(') | Allowed along with ⟨ŋ⟩ but strongly not recommended. |
| ㅈ | z | c |
| ㅉ | zz | cc | ⟨Z⟩ is allowed but strongly not recommended. |
| ㆆ | ? | q |
| ㅿ | x | z |
| ㅱ | m' | ? |
| ㅸ | f | ? |
| ㅹ | b' | ? |
| ㆄ | p' | ? |
| ᄛ(ퟝ) | r | ? |

The other romanization systems that I'd looked through look like they were made by people who seem to think that American English is the only language using Latin Alphabet or have no idea what they're doing. Although I'm most certainly one of them, I thought maybe I can make it better. That being said, this system, being the type of system it is, does not and cannot cover the proper use case of the current version of offical South Korean romanization.

But honestly, what I originally intended making was a system where I could use ⟨zz⟩ for ⟨ㅉ⟩, which was most intuitive. I thought it would work better when teaching Korean. It took longer than I initially imagined, but I somehow got here.
